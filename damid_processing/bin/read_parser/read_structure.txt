# Read structure file accompanying the parsing module

# For version 1.5

# This works by specifying all adapters / other sequences to be removed from the
# read. They can be used to filter the output, or extract more information from 
# the read.

# IMPORTANT:
# Use "-" as default / blank instead of whitespaces.

# The structure is as follows:
# - ID:              The name / identifier of the element (required!)
# - 5':              5' sequence (default: none) (Note: this can also be a .txt file with
#                    line separated entries)
# - 3':              3' sequence (default: none) (Note: this can also be a .txt file with
#                    line separated entries)
# - type:            Type of the element, described in more detail below (required!)
# - req:             Set requirement of this element: present, absent or not important
#                    (default: don't filter), see below for a complete list of options
# - second-read:     If paired end, is this in the first of second read? (default: 
#                    first read)
# - pos:             Is the position fixed (first/last base of the read), or can 
#                    the position vary (default: fixed)
# - keep-bases:      (Feature for DamID) Keep "n" bases from the filter. In case of
#                    DamID, you can then both cut and save the GATC sequence (and a 
#                    possible mismatch if present here). (Note: this cannot be used with
#                    5' and 3' sequences together, which also wouldn't make sense.)
#                    (default: no)

# "Type" described in more detail. Options are:
# - const:           Constant region (can include Ns). Only for filtering, to be removed
# - barcode:         Barcode. Will be removed, and readID - barcode association will be
#                    saved. 
#                    Format: "NNNNNNN" or "NNNGTGNNNN" (including actual bases) or
#                    "10" (an integer of the barcode length).
# - index:           Index region, basically the same as barcodes, but the reads will 
#                    be separated on index sequence. (Should this include unknown 
#                    indices, which can make things very messy, or should you then
#                    just use barcodes and figure it out yourself?) 
#                    Important!: This is not a really robust indexing method, and could
#                    use some improvement!
# - const_bar:       A constant region including a barcode, for when the barcode ends
#                    with just a few constant bases too short for a new element, or to
#                    detect a barcode insertion / deletion. The format for this is:
#                    "CGACAG{NNNNN}CATGA", where the Ns can also replaced with an 
#                    integer of the barcode length.
# - DNA:             A sequence to be returned in fastq format. Can be an integer of the
#                    DNA length. 
#                    (Note: because elements are parsed one at the time, this is always "single"
#                    end. However, only "good" reads are written, so two of these DNA elements
#                    where both are "required" can be seen as paired end data files)
# - const_DNA:       A mix between const_bar and DNA. Returned in fastq format
# - const_bar_comp:  This type is for the reverse complement of a barcode. Say, you have 
#                    readthrough, past the constant region of a barcode into the barcode
#                    itself, this allows you to replace the read-specific barcode
#                    with the previously found barcode. 
#                    Format: GATC[BC]TGAAG, where "[BC]" is the previously given barcode.

# # "Req" described in more detail. Options are:
# - "-" (default):   Do not filter reads based on this feature.
# - present:         Filter reads on the presence of this feature.
# - absent:          Filter reads on the absence of this feature.
# - group:[xxx]:     Filter reads on the presence of one the features with this
#                    specific group. You can add this "group:" + identifier to 
#                    multiple features, and reads will only be kept when one of
#                    these features have been found. Two considerations. 
#                    First, the only way to find out which element has been found 
#                    is to make the all_file, and parse this yourself. Two, using 
#                    this options, reads will not be filtered until all features 
#                    have been scanned, making it a bit less efficient (in case the 
#                    group-features are all at the beginning of the structure 
#                    file). (Note: I could of course do something with the feature
#                    that was found, just say what you'd like!)

# WARNING for const_xxx:
# Cutadapt uses an algorithm which maximizes the number of matches, while it's still
# within the max_error_rate. Usually this is not a problem, but for the const_xxx 
# class I use a very lenient max_error_rate to prevent the situation where the 
# whole pattern is matched, but a (small, 5bps?) edge not. However, the downside of 
# this is that a long edge can have a lot of insertions to get the highest number
# of matches, resulting in very short barcodes/DNAs found. This can be prevented 
# by having relatively small edges (5-10 bps?). A long constant part followed by
# a barcode is then best split in a first constant part and second a const_bar part
# Sorry for the inconvenience, but I can't (easily) change Cutadapt's alignment
# algorithm.

# Example (Note: please keep the header-line in your own file if you want to 
# this working):
